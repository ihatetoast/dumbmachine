# Doldrum Machine: a drum kit of dumb sounds

Toolbox:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass
- JavaScript
- Gulp
- My obnoxious voice

Note:

Almost two years ago, I did Wes Bos's JavaScript30. The first project was a drum kit. This time around I'm making my own and referring back when I need help, for example the audio clips. I know this would be better with ReactJS. Trust me. I get it. I have the following in too many places:

```
<div class="keys">
  <kbd>!</kbd>
  <kbd>1</kbd>
  <span class="sound">(bang)</span>
</div>
```

But I do think that having so many of those works for the "Dumb machine". There are many sounds out there. I am sure I'll do a drum kit with ReactJS, but not in this one.
